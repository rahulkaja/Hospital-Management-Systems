These contributors played a key role in building a Java-based healthcare platform designed to streamline hospital operations. The system integrates both command-line and GUI interfaces to support tasks such as managing patients, scheduling appointments, and handling billing efficiently.


## Healthcare System Project 
Project Overview-
The Healthcare System project provides a digital solution for managing healthcare operations, integrating features like patient records, appointment scheduling, billing, and more.

Software Requirements- 
Ensure the following software and libraries are installed on your system:  

Programming Language-  
-Java JDK: Version 17 or higher 

Libraries Used  
-Java Swing: For GUI development (comes with Java SE)  
  
Compile the Project-  

- Navigate to the project directory.  
- Compile all `.java` files using:  
      javac -d bin src//.java
       
Running the Code

Main Code (Backend)  

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly set up.  
2. Navigate to the `bin` directory where the compiled `.class` files are located.  
3. Run the backend (core logic) by executing:  
    java HealthcareSystem
     
4. Use the console interface to test functionalities such as patient management, appointments, and billing.  

GUI Code 

1. Ensure Swing dependencies are available (included with Java SE).  
2. Navigate to the `bin` directory.  
3. Launch the GUI application by running:  
   java HealthcareSystemGUI

4. Use the GUI for operations like:  
   - Adding and managing patients.  
   - Scheduling appointments.  
   - Generating bills.  


Commands Reference
